libschem
====================
This is a lightweight library to handle Minecraft Schematic Files, it is based on the WorldEdit implementation.
Note that it provides less features than the actual WorldEdit implementation in favour of reduced complexity.

Features:
- can load and save schematics
- can rotate schematics in the X-Z plane

Todo:
- merge upstream (we are quite a bit behind)
